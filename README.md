# The Mii Creator App
An unofficial WebView Mii Creator App for Android

> [!NOTE]  
> This is still in early access and things may break at any time, the current code is stable enough but still a bit of a mess and is planned to be rewritten from Java to Kotlin in the future.

Introducing the unofficial Mii Creator Android App!
Did you ever just want to create, edit or render a Mii but you always had to visit the Mii Creator Website and it took way too long? No...? Well, now it's on your Homescreen as an App on your phone! Yep, you can download and install it right now if you want [here](https://github.com/madebyiambest/Mii-Creator-App/releases). The project is also open-source so contributing is possible too!

## How it works?
This is basically a small browser that immediately visits the official Mii Creator website inside the app when you open it, with a few small tweaks to make it feel more like an actual app. It's in fullscreen, it has an error page with music, a loading animation and when you click something it doesn't have a blue hover effect! (how cool is that?!)

## What currently doesn't work:
- Downloading your Mii's QR Code, Exported Render or anything like that
- QR Code Scanner when importing a Mii (Not really sure why...)
- Discord passkey login and on some devices the Password Manager crashes when selecting your saved login (this happened on a Samsung phone for me only, if you have the same issue, please let me know and on what device it's happening on)
Please don't report the other issues tho, thanks!)

## What's planned:
- Instead of different versions of themes, the app should automatically detect your currently applied theme
- Discord login inside your default browser instead of the app
- Support different languages
- Rewriting the Main Java code to Kotlin
- Fix the current issues (obviously)
Suggestions are appreciated!

## FAQ
Frequenly asked Questions:
### How to install it?
After downloading the app with the theme you want to use on the Mii Creator website, you can download the App [here again](https://github.com/madebyiambest/Mii-Creator-App/releases). Also, you need to go to your browser downloads and open the .apk file. You might need to allow your browser to install Unknown Apps because it's not on the Play Store cause Nintendo would probably kill me. After giving it the permission, you just need to click install and you're done! (It's easier than it sounds)
On some newer android versions you might need to change additional security settings to download apps outside the Play Store.

### How to install Updates?
Updates are not downloaded or installed automatically, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dY2CmGw8NR) to get pinged when there's a new update available. Just follow the same steps you followed when you installed it.

### Where to report issues, suggest something or report bugs?
You can do this on GitHub directly but you can also do that in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dY2CmGw8NR) if you prefer that instead.

### Isn't this just a web app?
Yesn't, it's pretty much just a web app with a few tweaks that are mentioned in the Introduction above.

### Will there be support for Windows, MacOS, Linux or iOS?
Probably not, you can already add the Mii Creator Website as a web app on those devices but on Android, you can only add it to the Homescreen and it still opens inside the browser. I will consider it if the project gets more popular but I'm still new to this so I have to figure that out too.

### How is my Discord Login stored?
Your Discord Login is stored on your Device like on probably almost every Browser, it's not getting sent to me, in fact, nothing what you're doing inside the App is getting sent to me!

### Does this contain AI generated code, images or anything else?
Nope, there's nothing AI generated.

### How can I support this Project?
You can contribute on GitHub and help us fix bugs, improve and add new features to the App! You can also subscribe to the official [Mii Creator YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@miicreatorreal?si=Sxf5yvBo8bteUDGn) to support them. You can also support me on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/iam-best) but please note I only made the app, not the website.
# Just one more thing...
Huge thanks to everyone, that posted the same issues they had with Webview, Java and Android Studios that I had while making the App, a lot of code is from the community!
While making the App I also deleted a lot of personal data with Git accidentally (please don't ask how) so I really appreciate any help since this is also my first Android App! :)
